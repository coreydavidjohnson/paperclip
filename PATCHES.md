# Luma Paperclip patches

Base: `v2026.1005.0`, commit `467125fafb47a8520856504fecc48d6e32055db1`.
`upstream` follows `paperclipai/master`; `luma` carries the following separate
commits. There are no upstream issue or PR links by Corey's instruction.

## 1. External adapter composer capabilities

- Why: the built-in adapter allowlist hid task model/effort controls for
  external adapters even when they advertised models.
- Files: `packages/adapter-utils/src/types.ts`, `ui/src/api/agents.ts`,
  `ui/src/components/task-chat/composer-run-settings.ts`,
  `ui/src/components/task-chat/ComposerRunSettingsPicker.tsx`, and their two tests.
- Contract: a nonempty model catalog enables model selection. Optional
  `AdapterModel.reasoningEfforts` declares each model's effort choices.
  External settings use native `issue.assigneeAdapterOverrides.adapterConfig`
  `model` and `effort` keys. Built-in mappings remain compatible.
- Removal condition: upstream ships equivalent capability.
- Test: `pnpm --filter @paperclipai/ui exec vitest run
  src/components/task-chat/composer-run-settings.test.ts
  src/components/task-chat/ComposerRunSettingsPicker.test.tsx`.
  Includes an arbitrarily named external adapter, catalog fetch, effort/model
  selections, reset, unrelated override preservation and built-in regressions.

## 2. Patch tests gate production image builds

- Why: prevent publishing a fork image with a broken carried composer patch.
- Files: `Dockerfile`.
- Removal condition: upstream ships equivalent capability.
- Test: build `Dockerfile` target `production`; the `luma-patch-tests` stage
  must pass both composer test files, `ui/src/context/FileViewerContext.test.ts`
  and `pnpm check:token-gates` before app copy.

## 3. Ignore stale task file-browser navigation

- Why: a task file-browser callback could redirect Inbox back to a task after
  the user had left it. Turing authored source commit
  `efe29176c014c961a2e1fe5681c0326be723fd8c`.
- Files: `ui/src/components/task-side-panel/TaskSidePanel.tsx`,
  `ui/src/context/FileViewerContext.tsx` and its test.
- Contract: reject file-viewer search navigation when the current pathname
  differs from the route that created the callback.
- Removal condition: upstream ships equivalent capability.
- Test: `pnpm --filter @paperclipai/ui exec vitest run src/context/FileViewerContext.test.ts`.
  Covers navigation to Inbox, another task and updates on the current task.

## 4. External adapter create-task options

- Why: `NewIssueDialog` has its own three-adapter allowlist, independent of the
  chat composer. It disabled catalog fetching and discarded external overrides.
  `modelsCount` is adapter-manager display metadata, not a dialog capability.
- Files: `ui/src/components/NewIssueDialog.tsx`,
  `ui/src/lib/issue-assignee-overrides.ts`, their tests and `Dockerfile`.
- Contract: fetch the company-scoped dynamic catalog for the selected adapter.
  A nonempty catalog enables the existing model-lane controls; declared
  `reasoningEfforts` supplies external effort choices. Submit native
  `assigneeAdapterOverrides.adapterConfig.model` and `effort`. Primary lane
  sends no override; empty catalogs stay unsupported. Built-in mappings remain
  unchanged. Pending catalog fetches must not reset external draft settings.
- Removal condition: the pinned release's create dialog supports catalog-backed
  external overrides; re-evaluate on the next fork upgrade.
- Test: `pnpm --filter @paperclipai/ui exec vitest run
  src/components/NewIssueDialog.test.tsx src/lib/issue-assignee-overrides.test.ts`.
  An arbitrarily named external adapter exercises catalog fetching, model and
  effort selection, and the issue-create payload. Serializer tests cover empty
  catalogs, default lane and unchanged built-in keys. Include these tests in
  the lightweight homelab `Fork.Dockerfile` UI-rebuild gate too.

## Earlier image modifications inventory

Before this fork, homelab used the unmodified upstream release image and added
its own OmniGenT adapter plus `register-adapter.sh` entrypoint. These remain
homelab-owned integration files, not carried patches to Paperclip source.
The old held `omnigent-task-chat-picker.patch` was never applied or deployed;
it is superseded by patch 1, not part of the fork build.

## Homelab-owned database indexes (not fork server patches)

The deployment source is coreydavidjohnson/luma-homelab. Production
k8s/paperclip/70-db-indexes.yaml and its paperclip-staging copy own concurrent,
idempotent PostSync index builds. These indexes change no API or ownership rule.

- heartbeat_runs_company_ctx_paperclip_issue_idx: company ID and
  ((context_snapshot -> 'paperclipIssue') ->> 'id'), for secret-redaction issue
  lookups. Retire when an upstream migration supplies equivalent coverage.
- heartbeat_runs_company_effective_issue_idx: company ID,
  coalesce(native_issue_id::text, context_snapshot->>'issueId'), created_at DESC,
  id DESC. Covers the unchanged conversation ownership check. Homelab release
  f25c3ecdae58b827ead57a1fc588faff06df5271; retirement requires equivalent
  upstream coverage or all callers using existing native/context indexes.
- heartbeat_runs_company_creation_source_idx: company ID and
  coalesce(native_issue_id::text, nullif(context_snapshot->>'issueId', ''),
  nullif(context_snapshot->>'taskId', ''), nullif(context_snapshot->>'taskKey', '')).
  Covers creation provenance matching source UUID or identifier, preserving
  native-ID precedence and empty-string fallback. Homelab candidate/release
  source 69986e5739b0588abca8dfd5ddd4c9f05ba8312f. Deployment must be established
  from the owning Argo hook, live validity/readiness and unchanged query plan;
  this ledger entry alone is not deployment evidence. Retire only when upstream
  supplies equivalent coverage or no longer needs this predicate.

Before removing any carried index, compare exact definitions and live plans.
Jobs repair invalid builds only and retain working indexes. The regression
check is homelab tests/test_paperclip_ownership_index.py. Database query speed
is not proof of browser or phone performance. None of these indexes is copied
into the current fork image or supplied by a fork migration.

## Run-history query repair (PER-218)

- Approved by Corey in PER-218 comment fcba4d07-2918-457f-9203-9c157defdc0d.
  Local fork only: do not submit this patch upstream.
- Files: server/src/services/run-history-query.ts, activity.ts, heartbeat.ts,
  and run-history-query*.test.ts. No schema change or migration.
- Task membership uses the union of company-scoped context and activity run
  IDs. Outer company checks, agent join, ordering, projections, liveness and
  route authorization remain unchanged. Duplicate activity cannot duplicate results.
- Company list uses one lateral jsonb_to_record extraction for the same eight
  allowlisted text fields. Non-object context yields null fields. Existing
  bounded results, response assembly and secret redaction stay intact.
- Database-only option: existing company-created/context/activity indexes
  already serve these queries. Another index cannot remove repeated context
  detoasting. Read-only lateral comparison returned identical full projections,
  200 rows, 402–415 ms versus 102–111 ms.
- Released upstream: inspected v2026.1012.0 and deployed v2026.1005.0;
  their company context extraction and task OR/EXISTS remain. Closed proposals
  #6975/#7003/#7311 do not prove a shipped equivalent. No rebase.
- Tests: run-history-query.test.ts, run-history-query-db.test.ts,
  heartbeat-list.test.ts, activity-service.test.ts,
  heartbeat-context-summary.test.ts: 62 passing; server tsc --noEmit passes
  against the pinned dependency image. Fixtures cover non-object/null/scalar
  JSON, text compatibility, allowlist exclusion, duplicate paths, ordering,
  cross-company membership. Query-shape tests failed on baseline.
- Build: homelab Fork.Dockerfile must compile these three server sources and
  copy emitted JS. Base DB packages/migrations stay unchanged; lockfile
  equality mandatory. Remove when a released upstream equivalent passes
  these tests and comparable measurements, not when a proposal closes.

## Self-assigned decomposition (PER-258 / PER-135)

- Corey requested this repair in PER-258 on 2026-10-13; publish only to our fork.
- Adopt only the self-assignment delegation-guard hunk from upstream
  4039d4f06b4dfb4d12bd59831a0aabf2401053dc, not unrelated low-trust policy edits.
- Pass actorAgentId from both create routes; skip ancestor-delegator lookup
  only when assigneeAgentId equals the same actor. Company, ownership,
  assignment, approval and dependency-cycle checks remain unchanged.
- Regression: issue-assignee-invokability-routes.test.ts covers self-decomposition
  with an open actor-created ancestor and retains rejection of returning work
  to another open ancestor creator.
- Companion source-owned MCP repair in coreydavidjohnson/luma-homelab makes
  the existing direct-manager allowance independent of the subtree branch.
  It grants no peer, sibling or non-direct-ancestor assignment.
- Retirement: drop this hunk on a released upstream upgrade containing the
  same fix and passing this regression.
- Packaging must compile and copy server/dist/routes/issues.js; a fork pin
  alone cannot deliver this behavior through the current narrow overlay.

## Homelab-owned PostgreSQL JIT setting (PER-288 / PER-289)

- Owner: coreydavidjohnson/luma-homelab, k8s/paperclip/10-cnpg.yaml.
  Main commit 9cd742b1a890dd160011a24c94672cd51fe65371 sets jit: "off".
  This is deployment configuration, not a fork code patch or migration.
- Why: PostgreSQL compilation dominated the shared external conversation
  projection, even with empty chat tables. Five paired SQL diagnostics gave
  median 401.948 ms with JIT and 5.413 ms without it; not page acceptance.
- Verification: exact-source six-shard CI, synthetic Paperclip security canary,
  full owning Argo sync and SHOW jit=off on both production CNPG instances.
  Postmaster times did not change. Exact deployed selected-field projections
  matched with transaction-local jit on/off; 292 rows, JIT-off execution
  4.576 ms. Existing PER-218 UNION and creation-source index remain.
- Reconsider only after a released query change and comparable exact API/page
  measurements justify JIT. Retain authorization, ordering, projection and
  secret-redaction contracts. Do not reset shared pg_stat_statements.
- This ledger records the setting, not API p50 or full-render acceptance.

## Native Home Lab child delegation (PER-309 / PER-327)

- Why: platform work uses the existing child-create route even outside the
  caller's report tree or beneath an open Home Lab-created ancestor. The MCP
  board bridge had a parent-ownership race and must not be deployed.
- Contract: only authenticated standard agents with a bound running run can create a todo child
  for the unique active same-company Home Lab, from their own exact running
  parent run, with a native parent blocker. Admission is repeated under locks
  in the child-plus-blocker transaction, including cancellation and run identity.
  Ordinary assignment, standalone creation, reassignment, low-trust, watchdog,
  environment and monitor checks are unchanged. No new endpoint or grant.
- Files: server/src/services/home-lab-delegation.ts, services/issues.ts,
  routes/issues.ts and focused delegation tests.
- Removal condition: the pinned upstream implements equivalent shared-target
  child delegation with atomic ownership/run/cancellation enforcement; or
  Home Lab no longer serves as the shared platform delegation target.
- Local-only fork patch by Corey's decision; do not propose upstream.
